# 🧠 Handwritten Digit Recognition with CNN

Welcome! 👋 This project is all about teaching a computer how to **recognize handwritten digits (0 to 9)** using a type of deep learning model called a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**.

We’re using the classic **MNIST dataset**, which contains thousands of handwritten digits that look like this:

## ✨ What This Project Does

We train a neural network to:
- Look at an image of a digit (like a “3” or a “9”)
- Understand the patterns in the image
- Predict what digit it is with high accuracy

---

## 📦 The Dataset: MNIST

- **60,000 training images**
- **10,000 test images**
- All are **28x28 grayscale images**
- Each one shows a single digit (0 through 9)

## 🏗️ How the Model Works

We use a CNN, which is really good at "looking" at images. Here’s a simple breakdown of the layers in our model:

1. Convolutional layer to detect patterns
2. Pooling layer to reduce image size
3. More filters to detect deeper patterns
4. Flatten the image into a vector
5. A few dense layers (like a traditional neural network)
6. Output layer that predicts the digit!

The model learns by adjusting itself every time it gets something wrong until it gets really good at predicting.

## 🚀 How to Use This

### 1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mnist-cnn.git
cd mnist-cnn
```

### 2. Install the required libraries
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Train the model
```bash
python train.py
```

### 4. Evaluate the model
```bash
python evaluate.py
```

It will tell you how well it did and show some example predictions!

## 🧪 Results

🎯 Our model gets about **98–99% accuracy** on test data. That means it correctly guesses the digit almost every time!
